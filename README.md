# Mixed Messages - Fake Fact Generator
Mixed Messages is a simple Node.js application,<br/>
It will print a randomized fake fact to the terminal each time it is ran.

This project was created to practice javaScript syntax, GFMD and Git/GitHub workflows.<br/>
Have fun and feel free to leave an issue if you see a typo or encounter an error.

Fake fact examples:
> Did you know the libraries of Donald Trump were stolen from Australia?
>
> The Government doesn't want you to know John F. Kennedy was actually alive in 1253!
>
> Did you know rhinoceros were used as a currency by the Democrats until 1257?
>
>Did you know fish are actually just the horses of the Mississippi river?
>
>You should know people were used as a currency by the Democrats until 1626...
